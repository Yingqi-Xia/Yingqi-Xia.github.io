-I am currently working as a research assistant at Huazhong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Qing Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dRMbTCMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Shusong Ba](https://www.hkexgroup.com/Media-Centre/Corporate-Events/RMB-FIC-Conference/Past-Events/RMB-FIC-Conference-2019/Speakers/Hong-Kong/Prof-Shusong-BA?sc_lang=en). Prior to this, I earned a master’s degree in Economics from the Faculty of Business and Economics, the University of Hong Kong. I hold dual bachelor’s degrees in Statistics and Economics from Beijing Institute of Technology.
-My research interests lie in energy economics and environmental economics. I am also interested in the applications of machine learning in these fields.
-I am also the co-founder of [Hong Kong aiKnow Limited](https://aiknowhk.com), a startup that provides AI solutions for the manufacturing industry. Our company is supported by the Hong Kong Science Park and the University of Hong Kong.
